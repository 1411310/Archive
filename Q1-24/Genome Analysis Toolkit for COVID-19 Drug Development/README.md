This project involves analyzing COVID-19 genome sequences to aid drug development. Through exploratory data analysis, feature extraction, and clustering techniques, it aims to identify common genome properties. Utilizing K-means clustering and predictive modeling, the project explores optimal parameters for drug targeting. The final phase focuses on predicting bit scores and selecting regressors to find closely related genome sequences for targeted drug development.
