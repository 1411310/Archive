Letâ€™s consider a problem that arises often in manufacturing, transportation, and
testing applications. Suppose we are given a robot arm equipped with a tool, say a
soldering iron. In manufacturing circuit boards, all the chips and other components
must be fastened onto the substrate. More specifically, each chip has a set of contact
points (or wires) that must be soldered to the board. To program the robot arm
for this job, we must first construct an ordering of the contact points so the robot
visits (and solders) the first contact point, then the second point, third, and so
forth until the job is done. The robot arm then proceeds back to the first contact
point to prepare for the next board, thus turning the tool-path into a closed tour,
or cycle.
